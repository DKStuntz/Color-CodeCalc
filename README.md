# Color-CodeCalc
Color-coded calculator app, where each digit is represented by a color.

		This is a practice app, and it basically uses color codes -- a different color for each digit -- instead of the digits themselves.
		It's main purpose is web-design practice for me, and to provide a bit of fun.
		
		The color codes are based on that of a friend of mine, who associates a color with each digit.
		
		The color-coding is as follows:

			0: black
			1: yellow
			2: blue
			3: red
			4: orange
			5: white	
			6: green	
			7: purple	
			8: brown	
			9: gray
